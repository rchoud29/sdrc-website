                    <p>Racing rovers is an internal competition where teams engineer rovers to compete in a series of challenges ranging from autonomous navigation to race. This competition is perfect for any skill level because we host weekly workshops that teach various skills: CAD, programming, soldering, and more &mdash; everything needed to build a competitive rover. If you want to learn valuable engineering skills, gain hands-on experience, and just have a good time, then this club is perfect for you!</div>
